But this could lead to later fix in proofs (such as\n   a few unfold), since (x ?= y) is now pointing to\n   (Pos.compare x y), which is convertible but not syntactically\n   equal to (Pos.compare_cont x y) (the former Pcompare x y Eq).\n   So replacing the notation ?= by explicit Pcompare might be\n   preferable when porting code.

A few fragile scripts with explicit\n   references to automatically introduced names have been fixed.\n\n - A few fixes concern extraction: since the standard library has \n   changed, so has the extracted code...\n\n - Contribs containing ml code (e.g. tactics) that refer to positive/N/Z\n   constant is to adapt, since these constant are to be searched in\n   Coq.Numbers.BinNums.\n\n - Boolean tests {Z,N,Pos}.eqb are now noted \"_ =? _\".
