version including apartness and constructive order theory.","body":"Before this commit a lot of our abstract theory on fields and order could not be applied to the constructive reals in CoRN. This was due to the fact that division was parametrized by a proof of (≠) (which does not contain constructive contents) and big parts of our abstract order theory required (≤) to be total or decidable.\n\nFrom our previous experiences with CoRN we have learned that using CSetoids (setoids with apartness) everywhere is rather inconvenient in practice. Hence we only include apartness for fields instead of the whole hierarchy. Moreover, because setoid rewriting with Type'd relations does not work, we put apartness and strict order in Prop instead of Type. By incorporating type classes, and providing alternative constructors in case equality is decidable, one should not experience too much trouble from the apartness relation.\n\nSome important changes:\n* Some new classes, most importantly: StrongSetoid, StrongSetoid_Morphism, StrongInjective, Strong{Left,Right}Cancellation. Given instances of these classes we show that we have instances of Setoid, Setoid_Morphism, Injective, {Left,Right}Cancellation, respectively. One can go the other way around, in case equality is decidable, by hand.\n* A complete revision of the order hierarchy. Instead of a total order, we now use a pseudo order. These interfaces are quite preliminary, especially for ordered rings and semirings: they could possibly be strengthened and tidied up.\n* Include a class DecField, in which division is a total function (/0 = 0).\n* A lot of renaming: Le instead of Order, Lt instead of StrictOrder, etc.\n* Some tricks to avoid eager instance search (due to bug #2528).\n","diff":[{"file":"README","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/categories/JMcat.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/categories/algebra.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/categories/cat.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/categories/product.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/categories/variety.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/QType_rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/ZType_integers.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/cons_list.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/dyadics.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/fast_rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/field_of_fractions.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/nonneg_integers_naturals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/nonneg_semiring_elements.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/nonzero_field_elements.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/peano_naturals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/positive_semiring_elements.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/semiring_pairs.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/stdlib_binary_integers.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/stdlib_binary_naturals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/implementations/stdlib_rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/abstract_algebra.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/additional_operations.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/canonical_names.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/orders.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/ua_basic.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/interfaces/universal_algebra.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/misc/util.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/misc/workarounds.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/dec_fields.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/fields.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/integers.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/maps.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/minmax.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/naturals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/orders.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/rings.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/orders/semirings.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/abs.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/adjunctions.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/cut_minus.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/dec_fields.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/fields.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/int_abs.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/int_pow.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/integers.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/jections.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/monads.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/monoid_normalization.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/nat_distance.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/nat_pow.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/naturals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/rationals.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/rings.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/sequences.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/theory/series.v","status":"A","additions":3809,"deletions":2252},{"file":"src/t

The new formulation is much simpler and more to the point, because it only specifies what the result of integrating a single function on a single range must look like (namely Riemann sums).

interfaces for the rationals. Various new theorems on the rationals and int_pow. New implementation of the dyadics.","body":"Detailed changes:\n* We use the field of fractions in the rationals interface. This is convenient because Frac caries a proof that the denominator is non zero. Also we have already shown that the field of fractions contains a lot of structure. Before this interface used an ad-hoc pair to represent a fraction.\n* Instead of requiring an inverse of frac x y -> x / y, the interface now require an injective morphism of Q into Frac. We prove that this morphism is in fact the inverse of the above map.\n* We quantify over all integers implementations instead of using plain SRpair nat. This saves double work, because before we had to prove 1.) it gives rise to the required results on any integer implementations, and, 2.) we can construct a model of the rationals given the results on a specific integers implementation (alt_Build_Rationals). Now the first follows directly.\n* These changes make it much easier to prove theorems on the rationals. I have proven that each rationals implementation is isomorphic and that injective morphisms between rationals implementations are unique. Also, we directly have that every two rational implementations are order isomorphic.\n* Using these uniqueness results I created a new implementation of the dyadics. Equality is defined as (m,e) = (n,d) <-> m * 2^e = n * 2^d. As a result this new implementation is shorter, compiles faster and most proofs and definitions are more easy to understand.\n","diff":[{"file":"src/implementations/QType_rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/implementations/dyadics.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/implementations/field_of_fractions.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/implementations/intfrac_rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/implementations/stdlib_rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/interfaces/rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/orders/integers.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/orders/rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/bit_shift.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/fields.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/int_pow.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/integers.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/jections.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844},{"file":"src/theory/rationals.v","status":"M","additions":768,"deletions":844}]},{"hash":"2d95c97dbbae4f0f1dd0160720b01ffce38f04a1","author":"eelis@eelis.net","committer":"eelis@eelis.net","date":"2011-02-01T22:49:50+01:00","message":"Prove

This was first implicitly contained in natpair_integers.\n* The positive cone of a semiring is again a semiring. This was first this was implicitly contained in positive_integers_naturals.\n* Nice notations for the nonnegative, positive and negative cone.\n* Concrete orders for nearly all implementations implemented and a moreover a default order for the naturals, integers and rationals.\n\nAlso:\n* Params for nearly all operations are set to hopefully gain some speedups.\n* More consistent naming and various ugly proves cleaned up\n\nThis has the following advantages:\n* If we define an alternative order on the naturals, integers or rationals (for example from the standard library) it follows automatically that it coincides with any other order.\n* Our theorems about order also apply to orders from the standard library.\n* So... hopefully a much smoother integration with CoRN in which solely the orders from the standard library are used.\n* We can refer to order properties of the naturals, integers, rationals, with a common name. Also, beforehand we rarely proved any results about the order on the rationals, now we get all properties of ordered (semi)rings for free.\n* If we define a ring order (todo) on the dyadics we get all
