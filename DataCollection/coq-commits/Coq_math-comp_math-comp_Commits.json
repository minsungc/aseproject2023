(see #252)\n- Apply 80 chars per line restriction.\n\nGeneral changes:\n- Give consistency to shape of formulae and namings of `lt_def` and `lt_neqAle`\n  like lemmas:\n  lt_def    x y : (x < y) = (y != x) && (x <= y),\n  lt_neqAle x y : (x < y) = (x != y) && (x <= y).\n- Enable notation overloading by using scopes and displays:\n  + Define `min` and `max` notations (`minr` and `maxr` for `ring_display`) as\n    aliases of `meet` and `join` specialized for `total_display`.\n  + Provide the `ring_display` version of `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt`, `leif`, and\n    `comparable` notations and their explicit variants in `Num.Def`.\n  + Define 3 variants of `[arg min_(i < n | P) F]` and `[arg max_(i < n | P) F]`\n    notations in `nat_scope` (specialized for nat), `order_scope` (general\n    version), and `ring_scope` (specialized for `ring_display`).\n- Update documents and put CHANGELOG entries.\n","diff":[{"file":"CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/intdiv.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/rat.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/ssralg.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/ssrint.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/ssrnum.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/character/character.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/character/classfun.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/character/inertia.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/character/integral_char.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/character/vcharacter.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/field/algC.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/field/algebraics_fundamentals.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/field/algnum.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/field/finfield.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/all_ssreflect.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/fintype.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/order.v","status":"M","additions":4364,"deletions":2922}]},{"hash":"80bf757ad263efd615d517b68e155aaa4e68aa89","author":"Cyril.Cohen@inria.fr","committer":"Cyril.Cohen@inria.fr","date":"2018-02-23T13:57:56+01:00","message":"Initial

`bigop` enumeration handling","body":"Added lemmas `big_enum_cond`, `big_enum` and `big_enumP` to handle more\nexplicitly big ops iterating over explicit enumerations in a `finType`.\n   The previous practice was to rely on the convertibility between\n`enum A` and `filter A (index_enum T)`, sometimes explicitly via the\n`filter_index_enum` equality, more often than not implicitly.\n  Both are likely to fail after the integration of `finmap`, as the\n`choiceType` theory can’t guarantee that the order in selected\nenumerations is consistent.\n  For this reason `big_enum` and the related (but currently unused)\n`big_image` lemmas are restricted to the abelian case. The `big_enumP`\nlemma can be used to handle enumerations in the non-abelian case, as\nexplained in the `bigop.v` internal documentation.\n  The Changelog entry enjoins clients to stop relying on either\n`filter_index_enum` and convertibility (though this PR still provides\nboth), and warns about the restriction of the `big_image` lemma set to\nthe abelian case, as it it a possible source of incompatibility.\n","diff":[{"file":"CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/mxalgebra.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/mxpoly.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/poly.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/vector.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/character/classfun.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/character/inertia.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/character/integral_char.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/character/vcharacter.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/field/algebraics_fundamentals.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/field/cyclotomic.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/field/finfield.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/field/galois.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/fingroup/fingroup.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/fingroup/gproduct.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/bigop.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/binomial.v","status":"M","additions":224,"deletions":146}]},{"hash":"8b78152ce646d0f2f91b7c90f204dd98ef6a1d4b","author":"Cyril.Cohen@inria.fr","committer":"noreply@github.com","date":"2019-11-27T12:48:23+01:00","message":"Merge

`Arguments` command was that it would allow\nto centralise the documentation of the application of constants.\nIn that spirit it would be in my opinion better to make as much use of this\nas possible, and to document the parameter names whenever possible,\nespecially that of implicit parameters.\n\nand\n[here](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/pull/253#discussion_r237434163):\n\n> As a general rule, defined functional constants should have maximal prenex\nimplicit arguments, as this facilitates their use as arguments to functionals,\nbecause this mimics the way function constants are treated in functional\nprogramming languages with Hindley-Milner type inference. Conversely, lemmas and\ntheorems should have on-demand implicit arguments, possibly interspersed with\nexplicit ones, as it's fairly common for other lemmas to have universally\nquantified premises; also, this makes it easier to specify such arguments with\nthe apply: tactic. This policy may be amended for lemmas that are used as\nfunctional arguments, such as reflection or cancellation lemmas. Unfortunately\nthere is currently no easy way to tell Coq to use different defaults for\ndefinitions and lemmas, so MathComp sticks to the on-demand default, as there\nare significantly more lemmas than definition, and use the Prenex Implicits to\nredress matters in bulk for definitions. However, this is not completely\nsystematic, and is sometimes omitted for constants that are not used as\nfunctional arguments in the library, or inside the sections in which the\ndefinition occur, since such commands need to be repeated after the section is\nclosed. Since Arguments commands should document the intended constant usage as\nbest as possible, they should follow the implicits policy - even in cases such\nas this where the Prenex Implicits had been skipped.\n","diff":[{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/matrix.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/mxalgebra.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/poly.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/ssralg.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/ssrint.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/algebra/vector.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/character.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/classfun.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/inertia.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/integral_char.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/mxabelem.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/character/mxrepresentation.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/field/algebraics_fundamentals.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/field/closed_field.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/field/falgebra.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/fingroup/action.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/fingroup/fingroup.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/fingroup/quotient.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/abelian.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/burnside_app.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/center.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/commutator.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/cyclic.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/frobenius.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/gseries.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/jordanholder.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/maximal.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/nilpotent.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/pgroup.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/primitive_action.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/solvable/sylow.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/eqtype.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/finset.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/fintype.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250},{"file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/ssrnat.v","status":"M","additions":241,"deletions":250}]},{"hash":"03ad994dfee48e1a7b2b7091c45dfdcf4402f826","author":"Georges.Gonthier@inria.fr","committer":"Georges.Gonthier@inria.fr","date":"2018-11-26T19:51:27+01:00","message":"correct and improve signature and documentation of FieldMixin","body":"Documentation of FieldUnitMixin and FieldMixin corrected to reflect\nactual arguments, with mulVf and inv0 made explicit arguments for\nFieldMixin (they were implicit due to the extended signature of\nField.mixin_of).

put clear switch near view","body":"Dear devs, in an attempt to simplify the code of intro patterns we came up with a proposal that:\r\n- simplifies the code of the plugin\r\n- breaks only one line in the entire mathcomp, the one fixed by this patch.\r\n\r\nThe code we want to simplify is the one deferring clear switches inside an intro pattern.\r\nThe implementation is tricky because just delaying the clear switch until the end of the pattern is not enough, for example:\r\n```\r\nmove=> {x} /andP[x y].\r\n```\r\nIn this case `x` is both cleared and used. In order to be able to use `x`, given that the clear has not been performed yet, we rename `x` into `_x_` (when `{x}` is executed) so that when `x` is later executed we can use the name `x`, and then `.` is executed clear `_x_` instead of `x`.\r\n\r\nSo systematically \"always rename now & clear later\" seem to be OK, but it is not. The extra complication is that \"rename\" may break later intro pattern using terms as views. Eg\r\n```\r\nmove=> {x} /andP[Ha Hb] /x.\r\n```\r\nWhat the code does today is:\r\n- when `{x}` is execute look-ahead in the patter and see if `x` is used as a name to be introduced\r\n- if so, \"rename\"\r\n- otherwise don't rename (just delay)\r\nThis way of doing things is not only complicated but also incomplete, Eg\r\n```\r\nmove=> {x} /orP[x | /x].\r\n```\r\nwould misbehave, since the look-ahead is not \"semantic\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, the proposed behavior is:\r\n- `{x}` always renames now and clears (the renamed) later\r\n- `{clears}/views` is always \"compiled\" as `/views{clears}` (most of the occurrences in the library are ok with this simpler rule, but for the one fixed in this PR).\r\n- bonus: support `{}/view` (as in `rewrite {}rule`) to signal that the immediately following `view` has to be cleared, that is `{}/v` compiled as `/v{v}`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n```\r\n```","diff":[{"file":"mathcomp/field/separable.v","status":"M","additions":1,"deletions":1}]},{"hash":"c1ec9cd8e7e50f73159613c492aad4c6c40bc3aa","author":"Enrico.Tassi@inria.fr","committer":"noreply@github.com","date":"2018-04-12T17:14:20+02:00","message":"Merge
