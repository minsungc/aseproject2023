But this could lead to later fix in proofs (such as\n   a few unfold), since (x ?= y) is now pointing to\n   (Pos.compare x y), which is convertible but not syntactically\n   equal to (Pos.compare_cont x y) (the former Pcompare x y Eq).\n   So replacing the notation ?= by explicit Pcompare might be\n   preferable when porting code. Another solution used in a few cases\n   in this commit is to locally override the new notation by adding\n   this at the top of the contrib:\n\n    Infix \"?=\" := Pcompare : positive_scope.\n\n - Proofs that involves the internals of Z.add (ex-Zplus) will\n   probably involve now Z.pos_sub, the signed difference of two\n   positive. These proofs have been repaired by converting this\n   Z.pos_sub to the earlier internal formulation of Zplus, by some\n   rewrite Z.pos_sub_spec and possibly some unfold of Pos.compare\n\n - Pmult_nat is now just a compatibility notation for (Pos.iter_op plus),\n   hence unfold of Pmult_nat will fail, and should be replaced by\n   unfold of Pos.iter_op.\n\n - When a tactic such as destruct generates an hypothesis name,\n   it is based on the basename of the head of this hypothesis.\n   Since Zlt, Zle, Zgt, Zge are now compatibility notations for\n   Z.lt, Z.le, Z.gt, Z.ge, the generated names are now l, l0 or g, g0\n   instead of z, z0, ... A few fragile scripts with explicit\n   references to automatically introduced names have been fixed.\n\n - A few fixes concern extraction: since the standard library has \n   changed, so has the extracted code...\n\n - Contribs containing ml code (e.g. tactics) that refer to positive/N/Z\n   constant is to adapt, since these constant are to be searched in\n   Coq.Numbers.BinNums.\n\n - Boolean tests {Z,N,Pos}.eqb are now noted \"_ =? _\".
