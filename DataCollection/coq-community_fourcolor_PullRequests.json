.\r\nUnlike other instances of`_inj` lemmas where this was accidental, making the `x1 x2` arguments of `val_inj` explicit was intended. The reason is that unlike most injective functions, `val` is expected to compute, so that `x1` and `x2` can often not be inferred from an equation convertible to `val x1 = val x2`, and hence may often need to be specified when `val_inj` is explicitly applied. Here for instance `(edge u)` can't be found by unification.\r\n  The most obvious fix would be to amend math-comp/math-comp#253 to revert an unwanted change which I let slip by. On the other hand, it's probably not too important an issue since this is apparently the only file where `val_inj` is actually applied, and the first instance actually improves with `x1 x2` implicit, while the second remains passable if one uses the `(x1 := ...)` syntax (which becomes acceptable here as the `x1` name is now documented by `Arguments`. Ideally one should be able to write `((val_inj) (edge u) eu Deu)` as partial application does turn off trailing on-demand implicits; alas, the Coq elaborator does _not_ do that for a 0-ary partial application, as a \"special\" case (maybe that could be a feature request).\r\n   "},{"author":"ejgallego","file":"theories/gridmap.v","date":"2018-12-05T23:08:39Z","comment":"Barring the likely welcome improvement on the Coq elaborator, the question on compatibility with previous math-comp versions does remain, do you then prefer the version that relies on the new `Arguments` declaration of `val_inj`?"},{"author":"ggonthier","file":"theories/gridmap.v","date":"2018-12-05T23:46:33Z","comment":"All things considered I'm inclined to go for the new implicits status, because this keeps the implicits uniform across all infectivity lemmas.

Indeed it would be better to rename `[x1 x2]` into `[u1 u2]` as `u` is the conventional variable for a subtype argument in `eqtype.v`.\r\n   Perhaps the better fix in this would be to avoid the direct application of `val_inj` by making the script more declarative, using `have ->: v = u by apply/val_inj` instead of `rewrite` in the first instance, and adding a line:\r\n```\r\nhave{Deu} Deu: edge u = eu by apply/val_inj.\r\n```\r\nbefore a `rewrite -{eu}Deu ...` in the second instance."},{"author":"ejgallego","file":"theories/gridmap.v","date":"2018-12-06T00:10:51Z","comment":"Thanks!
