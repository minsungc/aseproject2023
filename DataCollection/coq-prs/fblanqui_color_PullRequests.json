Many previous PRs did get their CI status reported. Note though that Travis is planning to move away all open source projects from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com (and the two websites do not report their statuses in the same way). You can request to migrate your repository to travis-ci.com (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-on-travis-ci-com/#existing-open-source-repositories-on-travis-ciorg) and it is likely that it will fix this issue."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"2f0afe5a7d6805bbca29e18b3771192ac0db40aa","message":"Make explicit hint databases for “firstorder”","date":"2020-01-22T14:39:55Z"},{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"beca93a5e95ff367bb007b508ef90fc423bd8562","message":"Minor simplification","date":"2020-02-26T13:49:53Z"}]},{"author":"vbgl","number":20,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Coccinelle/examples/cime_trace/ring_extention.v","status":"M","additions":11,"deletions":7},{"file":"Term/SimpleType/TermsConv.v","status":"M","additions":11,"deletions":7},{"file":"Util/Integer/ZUtil.v","status":"M","additions":11,"deletions":7}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2019-11-05T12:39:45Z","update_date":"2019-11-05T13:16:31Z","discussion":[],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"5c9ed65e389a771cbe78a3a26b44d01c4a5ad450","message":"Be careful with “firstorder”, “intuition”, “auto with zarith”","date":"2019-11-05T12:38:05Z"}]},{"author":"vbgl","number":19,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Util/FGraph/FGraph.v","status":"M","additions":15,"deletions":13},{"file":"Util/FGraph/TransClos.v","status":"M","additions":15,"deletions":13},{"file":"Util/FMap/FMapUtil.v","status":"M","additions":15,"deletions":13},{"file":"Util/FSet/FSetUtil.v","status":"M","additions":15,"deletions":13}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2019-09-30T08:02:44Z","update_date":"2019-10-02T12:05:33Z","discussion":[{"author":"fblanqui","date":"2019-10-02T12:05:52Z","comment":"Thanks @vbgl !"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"d7c0e0579436b51f95005373f4f5635fdec406c7","message":"Use hints from the “ordered_type” database","date":"2019-09-11T07:15:13Z"}]},{"author":"maximedenes","number":18,"diff_summary":[{"file":"MatrixInt/AMatrixBasedInt.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"PolyInt/PolyChecker.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"RPO/VRPO_Results.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"SemLab/ASemLab.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"Term/Lambda/LCompRewrite.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"Term/WithArity/AMonAlg.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"Term/WithArity/AMorphism.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"Util/Polynom/Polynom.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17},{"file":"Util/Set/FinSet.v","status":"M","additions":25,"deletions":17}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2019-07-15T14:27:59Z","update_date":"2019-07-15T14:55:29Z","discussion":[{"author":"fblanqui","date":"2019-07-15T14:55:47Z","comment":"Thanks @maximedenes !"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"maximedenes","committer":"maximedenes","hash":"afce268c10f8fe9356a54fd61154d5260ae2b4dc","message":"Avoid relying on `Export` bugs\n\nSee https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10474 and\nhttps://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10480","date":"2019-07-15T14:26:43Z"}]},{"author":"vbgl","number":17,"diff_summary":[{"file":"DP/ASCCUnion.v","status":"M","additions":1,"deletions":1}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2019-03-22T08:53:14Z","update_date":"2019-03-22T09:19:27Z","discussion":[{"author":"fblanqui","date":"2019-03-22T09:19:38Z","comment":"Thanks Vincent!"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"c7cbf14bca43d1a60d33ccb2515b622541b4453c","message":"Don’t rely on a random hint","date":"2019-03-22T08:50:29Z"}]},{"author":"vbgl","number":15,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Util/Integer/BigZUtil.v","status":"M","additions":2,"deletions":76},{"file":"Util/Nat/BigNUtil.v","status":"M","additions":2,"deletions":76}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2018-11-05T13:18:11Z","update_date":"2018-11-05T15:53:55Z","discussion":[],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"vbgl","committer":"vbgl","hash":"0da80efb2411ebc5b95b97e6c43596a12c07eb4e","message":"Remove decidability lemmas about big numbers","date":"2018-10-31T16:00:35Z"}]},{"author":"jashug","number":14,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Util/FMap/FMapUtil.v","status":"M","additions":1,"deletions":1}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2018-10-26T04:23:51Z","update_date":"2018-10-26T16:22:25Z","discussion":[{"author":"fblanqui","date":"2018-10-26T16:22:35Z","comment":"Thanks!"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"jashug","committer":"jashug","hash":"7af5d506b94a72175f490f926abe5c46520b292e","message":"Remove duplicate abstraction.\n\n`A` is abstracted over as a section parameter;
