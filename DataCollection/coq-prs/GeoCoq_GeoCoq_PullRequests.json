You seems to have duplicated a lot of lemmas. For example the first three lemmas are just permutation of lemmas which are already available in GeoCoq. I would prefer not to duplicate so many lemmas. \r\nFor example the use of lemma STl6_16_1b can be replaced by the use of the tactic ColR.\r\n Another example is : triangle_par_mid2 You don't need to introduce a new lemma, you can just use triangle_par_mid followed by tactics to deal with permutations: see Finish,  or perm_apply\r\n\r\nCan you please simplify your code ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJulien\r\n"},{"author":"CoghettoR","date":"2019-09-20T11:34:05Z","comment":"ok, I'm refactoring the code.\r\nRoland"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"CoghettoR","committer":"web-flow","hash":"1f709fe9d664f9191bfd91a1e2b83bde73f5c7ac","message":"Create SegmTrisect.v\n\nTrisection Segment","date":"2019-09-14T07:35:41Z"}]},{"author":"maximedenes","number":18,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Meta_theory/Models/tarski_to_euclid.v","status":"M","additions":39,"deletions":38},{"file":"Tarski_dev/Annexes/inscribed_angle.v","status":"M","additions":39,"deletions":38},{"file":"Tarski_dev/Ch10_line_reflexivity_2.v","status":"M","additions":39,"deletions":38},{"file":"Tarski_dev/Ch11_angles.v","status":"M","additions":39,"deletions":38}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2019-09-05T16:28:12Z","update_date":"2019-09-10T05:48:40Z","discussion":[{"author":"maximedenes","date":"2019-09-10T02:05:01Z","comment":"CI has succeeded: https://travis-ci.org/GeoCoq/GeoCoq/jobs/581295052\r\n\r\nCan this PR be merged?
