I don't see why a library of Coq would have a weaker license : when people `Require Import` a file from constructive measure theory, they also `Require Import` files from the stdlib, so using and developing constructive measure theory has the same obligations as using and developing in the stdlib."},{"author":"spitters","date":"2020-08-01T17:08:51Z","comment":"I believe it was @Zimmi48 who remarked that would that choose a license again, it would be MIT, as opposed to LGPL2. Since they are compatible (as I understand), MIT seems the better choice going forward.\r\nHowever, I don't feel strongly about this."},{"author":"Zimmi48","date":"2020-08-01T17:40:02Z","comment":"Say one wanted to have a version of CoRN work with the HoTT library instead of the standard library. The former doesn't depend on the latter and is not under LGPL license but under a BSD2 license, which is pretty equivalent to the (more popular nowadays) MIT license. By having CoRN be distributed under LGPL, you put some additional constraints on this person, that they wouldn't have if you had chosen MIT. This is just to counter your argument about this choice being the only reasonable one since the stdlib is already under this license."},{"author":"Zimmi48","date":"2020-08-01T17:40:56Z","comment":"That being said, this license issue is not very important to me TBH and, as I've said before, I'm not opposed to the use of LGPL for CoRN. It will already be more permissive if it's adopted project-wide compared to GPL."},{"author":"VincentSe","date":"2020-08-01T18:52:01Z","comment":"@Zimmi48 @spitters It's MIT now.

But I'm relatively confident in my interpretation of standard open source licenses based on [my experience reading about them and discussing them](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/users/5858/zimm-i48).\r\n\r\n>by using the MIT license you would wrongly let CoRN users assume more permissions than they actually have\r\n\r\nLet us be specific. No open source license (be it MIT, LGPL or GPL) places any restriction on how you can *use* a piece of software. Software licenses that do place restrictions on usage (like [CompCert's Non-Commercial License](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert/blob/master/LICENSE)) are non-free and non-open source. Open source licenses restrict how you may *redistribute* the software or a derivative.\r\n\r\nFor instance, with a copyleft license (like the LGPL) you may not distribute a binary version without also making the sources available, and if you create a derived version, you may be bound by the same restrictions.\r\n\r\nIf I distribute Coq + CoRN, of course, I am bound by the terms of Coq's license. However, if I distribute only CoRN, I am only bound by the terms of CoRN's license. So it makes a difference.\r\n\r\n>What I propose is much simpler : one license for both Coq and CoRN.\r\n\r\nI agree that what you propose is very simple. However, my point (which was previously raised by @robbertkrebbers) is that if you go through the burden of relicensing CoRN, you may as well go one step further and choose a more permissive license. If some day, Coq's standard library itself is relicensed under a more permissive license (which would be difficult but not impossible), it would be sad to have to conduct again the same relicensing process for CoRN. Choosing a permissive license that allows relicensing (like MIT or BSD) now guarantees against such issue."},{"author":"VincentSe","date":"2020-05-31T15:31:29Z","comment":"> I agree that what you propose is very simple.\r\n\r\n@Zimmi48 Great, let's keep it simple.

For instance, according to GPL's FAQ [What is the difference between “mere aggregation” and “combining two modules into one program”?](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html#MereAggregation), two binaries which interact through a communication channel rather than being linked together can be combined whatever the license of the other is if one is GLP.\r\n\r\nSo, having Coq source code in different licenses such as GPL, LGPL or MIT seems to be no problem. The burden is put on who wants to make a binary executable out of the code having different licenses: they will have to make the components whose licenses are incompatible to communicate over a channel rather than by linking.\r\n\r\nIs this interpretation correct? And if yes, is this constraint put on who wants to create a binary out of Coq code so critical?\r\n\r\nOne may also wonder whether distributing source code should satisfy that the licenses of every code present in the distributed archive have to be compatible. Still according to the GPL FAQ above, it is ok to put side by side a GPL program with a distinct program having any other license on the same CD-ROM. So, it is a fortiori ok to do so for the sources of the programs (and we actually already do it for the platform).\r\n\r\nTL;DR: From the Coq point of view, I don't see problems with incompatible licenses other than forcing people interested in producing binaries to have the incompatible binaries in separate processes, and, for compatible licenses, to adopt the license resulting of this compatible match.\r\n\r\nThe remaining questions are then \"political\". Do we want to force people possibly producing binaries (such as a certified compiler with a floating point component) to have these libraries communicating over a channel rather than being linked? In practice, it is not even sure that it matters, since the executable part of CoRN, which is the part liable to be linked in a binary, is already MIT. Then, the actual licence incompatibilities I know regarding real numbers are with Flocq and Coquelicot, but, since there are less developers involved here, it may be easier to change the license of these packages, say, from LGPL 3 to LGLP 2 or any later version so that any combination of code related to real or floating-point numbers become acceptable as part of a same binary.\r\n"},{"author":"Zimmi48","date":"2020-07-28T10:18:28Z","comment":"If someone wants to build a certified piece of software they may be interesting to depend on more than one Coq library. If they do so, then they create a derivative work of the various libraries they picked. If these libraries' licenses are not compatible, they won't be able to do so. It's as simple as this. Discussing workarounds like having two independent programs communicate on a textual channel doesn't make sense in a software verification context IMHO.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, no, combining is not just about binaries. If it were, then programs in interpreted languages wouldn't be submitted to the same kind of constraints than the rest. It would also mean that people could write proprietary code that depends on a GPL'd library and distribute the two side by side (as source code) and put whatever restrictions they want on the code they wrote."},{"author":"spitters","date":"2020-07-28T17:50:49Z","comment":"Corn has had MIT code in the fast/ directory since 2007.\r\n"},{"author":"herbelin","date":"2020-07-28T18:14:51Z","comment":"@Zimmi48, I'm concerned by the current CoRN situation but I don't have a strong experience with licenses, my apologies.

Or am I missing something ?\r\n\r\nYou are inverting the situation. Actually, it is the GPL of CoRN that \"forces\" the combination of Coq and CoRN to be GPL, under two different possible mechanisms (any person distributing such a combination can choose which mechanism to use).\r\n\r\nUnder section 6 of the LGPLv2.1, one is allowed to link an LGPL-covered work (such as Coq and/or its \"theories\" standard library) with any other work (such as CoRN), and redistribute the combination, with some quite weak conditions on the licence of the \"other work\". The GPL fulfils these weak conditions. In effect, the license of the result of the combination of Coq and CoRN is the GPL. (\"Obviously\" if one takes out Coq without CoRN from the combined work distributed under section 6, then that copy of Coq can be used and redistributed under the LGPL.) This is the same mechanism that allows a closed-source program, distributed as binary executable code only, to link dynamically against an LGPL-covered library. Or a free-as-in-free-speech / open source software under a GPL-incompatible license to do the same.\r\n\r\nAnother path for this specific case is that LGPL section 3 allows any person having a copy of Coq to redistribute _that copy_ under the GPL. Then you have a GPL Coq and a GPL CoRN, and the combination is covered by the GPL. That path is specific to GPL, it doesn't work for any other license."},{"author":"lmamane","date":"2020-08-10T17:53:50Z","comment":"> I agree that what you propose is very simple. However, my point (which was previously raised by @robbertkrebbers) is that if you go through the burden of relicensing CoRN, you may as well go one step further and choose a more permissive license. If some day, Coq's standard library itself is relicensed under a more permissive license (which would be difficult but not impossible), it would be sad to have to conduct again the same relicensing process for CoRN. Choosing a permissive license that allows relicensing (like MIT or BSD) now guarantees against such issue.\r\n\r\nTo guard against such issue, no need to relicense to a non-copyleft license. You only need to change the license of CoRN to \"Lesser GPL v2.1 or later, or, at your option, the license of the Coq standard library (theories directory as of time of writing)\". Provided all copyright holders agree, that is not more work than relicensing to \"Lesser GPL v2.1 or later\". In other words, \"Lesser GPL v2.1 or later, with the added permission that you can also choose the same licence as the Coq Standard Library (theories directory)\". In effect the copyright holders say they trust the Coq copyright holders to make good choices in the future, and delegate to them collectively together (not individually) the power to relicense CoRN.\r\n\r\nA more complicated setup which works in other scenarios is to give that power to an identified institution or group of persons... The Free Software Foundation, the Radboud University, the group \"Bas Spitters and Robbert Krebbers and Herman Geuvers\", the CNRS, the NWO or whatever the copyright holders collectively choose. I don't think that is a good setup for CoRN, but if that's what other people want, I'm willing to consent to a reasonable identified institution or group of people."},{"author":"lmamane","date":"2020-08-10T18:13:12Z","comment":"> here doesn't seem to be a reason to go for LGPL, over MIT/BSD.\r\n\r\nWell, this harks back to the question \"why is CoRN under the GPL in the first place?\" and the related \"why is Coq under the Lesser GPL, rather than MIT/BSD/...\"? For me, it is linked to a certain view of scientific progress and the role you have (and I had at the time) as academics. That things are done incrementally, by standing on the shoulder of giants, and we add the common pot of humanity's advancement and knowledge. And whether, or not, people should be allowed to make use of that common pot without contributing back their work to that same common pot. That used to be \"obvious\"; Newton and Leibnitz never had to worry whether someone making improvements on the calculus the developed would use the improved calculus for personal gain, but forbid others from further improving the improved calculus. Bohr and Heisenberg didn't have to worry that people making refinements to their Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics would forbid other people to make further refinements. The idea would have seemed outlandish, bizarre and just not possible.\r\n\r\nWe now live in a world where that is not obvious anymore. And thus, as far as we intend our work to be in an ecosystem of \"common pot\", we have to use mechanisms like copyleft to express that. There is a strong copyleft (the GPL) and a weak copyleft (the Lesser GPL). The argument, which is being made, that CoRN would be better served by being under a weak copyleft doesn't mean we to throw away the baby with the bathwater and abandon all expression of the common pot ecosystem, going all the way to no copyleft at all.\r\n\r\nSecrecy of knowledge is so abhorrent to humanity and progress of humanity, that about a century (and a half?) ago, when secrecy of new ideas was a concrete problem, leading to loss of progress when people died, humanity devised a system, and agreed to make sacrifices, to entice inventors of new ideas to make them public, through the patent system: give the inventor a _temporary_ monopoly on usage of his idea, in exchange for making the idea public. That was the basic deal. Under the same basic position (abhorrence of secret of ideas leading to progress), we use copyleft to discourage secrecy."},{"author":"herbelin","date":"2020-08-20T21:42:08Z","comment":"> FYI, the license of camlp5 is what is known as 3-clause BSD (BSD3 for short and BSD-3-Clause in the SPDX classification) and yes, [it is compatible with the (L)GPL licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ModifiedBSD).\r\n\r\nOK, thanks.\r\n\r\nFollowing  @lmamane's comments, I would like to add two comments.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the situation, it is probably worth to replace the discussion in an historical context which changed in the last 20 years. At some time, part of the academic world was pretty irritated by the closed attitude of some big software companies (as witnessed by critical books and posts at this time). That justified, in reaction to these attitudes, to strongly defend strict copyleft policies. Some of these companies learnt from it and started to support open source software (e.g. acquiring GitHub), reducing this feeling of a conflict between proprietary and open source software. On the other side, the emergence of startups in domains close to us, and sometimes from colleagues, contributed to the idea that it is legitimate for such startups to protect their source, at least temporary, so that they can simply live from their work. Another aspect whose impact on the current ways of thinking I'm not able to quantify is the role of \"permissive\" approaches to licensing such as the one defended by the widely spreaded interpreted language Python.\r\n\r\nMy second comment is a question: do we have a clear idea of the impact of a license in our field?\r\n\r\nAt the technical level, I see at least two situations where an entity might want to keep a Coq development secret.\r\n\r\n  1. A certification proof can be a commercial argument and some actors may want to announce that they prove some correctness properties without releasing the proof (this happened e.g. for the certification of JavaCard properties). In this case, a certification agency serves as third-party trustee. But in any cases, the proofs are not distributed, so the license of the public code possibly used in the certification has a priori no impact, right?\r\n\r\n  2. A Coq development is used by extraction to produce a software (e.g. a certified compiler, or certified server). If the dependencies of this software are in a permissive license, the software can be distributed without releasing the source without thinking further. If some (unmodified) dependencies are in a strong copyleft license (GPL), some constraints will be put on the distributed executable if the author would not like to distribute the sources. Typically, the users will be asked to download and extract independently the strong copyleft Coq dependencies of the executable to make themselves a fully operational software. If this way of doing is compatible with the words of strong copyleft (and the users ok to do the combining themselves), this is a burden, but not a so strong one.\r\n\r\nIn the latter, I neglect the moral aspect. If the intent of the author of the strong copyleft license is to force works depending on it to be released with sources, it might be unwelcome to bypass this intent and be (morally) dommageable to release without sources. On the other side, the strong copyleft might be considered too constraining for who wants to release executables without releasing the sources and move them to rely on other, more permissive, dependencies. Yet on another side, good ideas kept secret do not remain secret for long. For instance, proprietary spreadsheets or word processors did not so much prevent the development of open-source similar softwares. Proprietary drivers did not significantly prevent developing open-source versions of these drivers. This is a question of time, and a natural swing of the pendulum, which we can see in other situations (e.g. the current reactions to an excess of tracking of internet users).\r\n\r\nAt the end, my feeling is that what really matters is not the technical impacts but the moral impact (and a regular attention that no actors abuse their power).\r\n\r\nBack to the PR, I see that several people would feel more comfortable with sending the message of a more permissive license, either MIT-like, or LGPL 2.1, or \"Lesser GPL v2.1 or later, or, at your option, the license of the Coq standard library (theories directory as of time of writing)\". Do we then try to go for the latter, which after all seems reasonable? Then, an appropriate mail to CoRN developers could be prepared.\r\n"},{"author":"spitters","date":"2020-08-21T09:17:17Z","comment":"Thanks Hugo for the careful response.

CoRN has a single branch (`master`) which is tested with several versions of Coq. This is the recommendation for libraries: instead of being compatible with only one version of Coq at once, compatibility is maintained with a range of versions. This means that users can bump the version of Coq they use without changing the version of CoRN and conversely can bump the version of CoRN without changing the version of Coq (makes up for smoother upgrades).\r\n\r\nThat being said, this doesn't mean that there cannot be exceptions to this policy.\r\n\r\n>CoRN is in Coq's continuous integration, so we know that it is possible to build both (and much more) on each PR.\r\n\r\nYes, and if you click on the \"Details\" button of the Travis failure, you can see that your PR actually did succeed with Coq master."},{"author":"VincentSe","date":"2020-04-01T09:17:11Z","comment":"@Zimmi48 @spitters Ok, fair enough.
