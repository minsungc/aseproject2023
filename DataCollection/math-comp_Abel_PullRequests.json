I proved that any extension that is solvable by radical is solvable in any characteristic, but not the converse, so AbelGalois still requires a root of unity, which makes my generalization pretty useless. When I try to prove the missing part following Lang's Algebra book, I need to prove that the galois trace is not 0, which relies on the independance of characters, whose proof takes two different characters and chooses a point where they differ. This is supposed to be applied to members of a galois group, whose domains are infinite, which makes this step non-constructive. Is there a constructive proof of this theorem, or else what should I do, I guess we do not want to rely on boolp from mathcomp-analysis ?"}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"theories/abel.v","date":"2023-02-03T15:50:28Z","comment":"This was here: https://github.com/math-comp/Abel/blob/94499667cc4464f7748a2fd909e628a8f86a998e/theories/xmathcomp/various.v#L265-L266\r\nAnd it's being ported to mathcomp in this PR: https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/pull/944/files#diff-2d6a4ea70d7630c940ac8075abbc6ff46d30c54f80c29291131b711b195368e6R1839 "},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"theories/abel.v","date":"2023-02-03T15:53:40Z","comment":"this should be renamed `big_if` and ported back to mathcomp."}],"tags":[],"commits":[{"hash":"06ea22a3f38aa23ab05e9801ff739ccd0f6c3490","message":"Abel-Galois for any characteristic","date":"2023-02-03T15:18:24Z"},{"hash":"4ab6ab8dfe719d21567242f668952ec3fc5d223d","message":"fix hornerE changing behaviour between mc versions","date":"2023-02-03T17:52:33Z"},{"hash":"6664b1107a0913e7f23908026cec03919f6a0c0a","message":"update on suggestions","date":"2023-02-03T21:07:03Z"}]},{"author":"proux01","number":82,"diff_summary":[{"file":".github/workflows/docker-action.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.11+mc1.12.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.12+mc1.12.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.13+mc1.12.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.13+mcmathcomp-1.15.0.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.14+mc1.12.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.14+mcmathcomp-1.15.0.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.15+mcmathcomp-1.15.0.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".github/workflows/nix-action-coq8.16+mcmathcomp-1.15.0.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":".nix/config.nix","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":"README.md","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":"coq-mathcomp-abel.opam","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":"meta.yml","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420},{"file":"theories/xmathcomp/various.v","status":"D","additions":487,"deletions":420}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2023-01-11T20:38:33Z","update_date":"2023-01-12T14:07:38Z","discussion":[{"author":"proux01","date":"2023-01-12T14:04:00Z","comment":"@CohenCyril CI green (the 4 failures correspond to mc1.12 which we drop), merging this would allow to merge https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/pull/956"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"proux01","committer":"proux01","hash":"d1fc008641df98a2d02ef33f575b43fa0a49590e","message":"Adapt to future MathComp 1.16.0","date":"2023-01-11T20:38:01Z"}]},{"author":"SnarkBoojum","number":81,"diff_summary":[{"file":"theories/abel.v","status":"M","additions":8,"deletions":4},{"file":"theories/xmathcomp/various.v","status":"M","additions":8,"deletions":4}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2022-09-13T14:33:12Z","update_date":"2022-09-20T13:37:52Z","discussion":[{"author":"SnarkBoojum","date":"2022-09-14T07:33:10Z","comment":"I'm pretty sure the second patch works with the current hornerE, but I'm not sure it still flies with the proposed new one ; I'm going to check."},{"author":"SnarkBoojum","date":"2022-09-14T10:42:52Z","comment":"Ok, now I think we have something!"},{"author":"SnarkBoojum","date":"2022-09-15T13:03:43Z","comment":"I followed the suggestion."},{"author":"proux01","date":"2022-09-20T13:06:22Z","comment":"@CohenCyril CI green, this is backward compatible, could you merge?

Proof of Abel Galois minus one result about cyclotomic poly\n\nThe file `abel.v` is stripped from most preliminary results, which are\ndispatched across other files.\n\n- `abel.v` itself contains the main theorems:\n  + `galois_solvable_by_radical` (requires explicit roots of unity),\n  + `ext_solvable_by_radical` (equivalent, and still requires roots of unity),\n  + `radical_solvable_ext` (no mention of roots of unity),\n  + `AbelGalois`, (equivalence obtained from the above to, requires\n    roots of unity)\n   and their consequence `example_not_solvable_by_radicals`\n\n- `various.v` contains various (rather straightforward) extensions that\n  should be added to various mathcomp packages asap,\n\n- `char0.v` contains 0 characteristic specific results, that could use a\n  refactoring for a smoother integration with mathcomp. e.g. ratr gets\n  a canonical structure or rmorphism when the target field is a\n  lmodType ratr, and we provide a wrapper NullCharType akin to\n  PrimeCharType (from finfield.v),\n\n- `cyclotomic.v` contains complementary results about cyclotomic\n  polynomials, (there is still one admit),\n\n- `map_gal.v` contains complementary results about galois groups and\n  galois extensions, including various isomorphisms, minimal galois\n  extensions, solvable extensions, and mapping galois groups and\n  galois extensions from a splitting field to another. This last\n  construction is essential in switching to fields with roots of unity\n  when we do not have them yet,\n\n- `classic_ext.v` contains the theory of classic extensions by arbitrary\n  polynomials, most of the results there are in the classically monad,\n  making the results available either for a boolean goal or a\n  classical goal.
