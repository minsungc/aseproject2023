You can override this and put yourself by setting the `opam-file-maintainer` variable in the `meta.yml` file. In any case, feel free to publish the new versions on opam of this package (of which you are indeed the maintainer) and of any other package in fact (the good thing about the publishing process being via a git repository is that it is easy to collaborate on publishing packages, and it doesn't need to be always the maintainer who does it).
