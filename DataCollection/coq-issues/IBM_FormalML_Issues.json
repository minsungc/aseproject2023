What version of Coq are you using?  We currently use `8.12.2`.  Something in the `8.12` line should work, but we have not tested with newer versions, and it is very likely that things break due to changes in hypothesis naming and such.\r\n\r\nIf this is a problem for your intended use case (e.g. if you are thinking of using it as part of another development), please tell us, and what version of Coq you need to use."},{"author":"davidenitti","date":"2023-03-26T12:53:37Z","comment":"thanks, I managed to compile it by downgrading coq, do you know how I can import the library in coqide?

Within CoqIde there is also a `Compile > Make` option that I see which might help, although I haven't tried it myself.
