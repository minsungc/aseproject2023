Can you please clarify, complete the work if needed, and merge? @CohenCyril @ggonthier\r\n\r\nI was a bit worried about the backward compatibility issues triggered by this PR, but after @pi8027's experiments, it does not not look so bad. I also thought @ggonthier could be opposed to it for the same reasons (or others?). I think we can merge for the beta and backtrack if this causes more trouble than relief to our users (in the former case, we could have distinct spec lemmas for the enhanced cased analysis instead of overloading `leqP`...)."},{"author":"ybertot","date":"2020-04-01T11:21:15Z","comment":"Thanks @pi8027 @CohenCyril "}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"pi8027","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/ssrnat.v","date":"2019-11-23T00:54:43Z","comment":"Currently, this ordering is the same as in `order.v` but probably should be `(minn n m) (minn m n) (maxn n m) (maxn m n) (m <= n) (n < m)`."},{"author":"pi8027","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/ssrnat.v","date":"2020-01-03T15:03:17Z","comment":"Done.
