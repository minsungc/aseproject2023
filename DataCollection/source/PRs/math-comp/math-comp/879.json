Where can I find your code to see if it is an ok replacement for what you have put in this PR?\r\n\r\nThe code where I use the finite field construction is at [verified-network-toolchain/Verified-FEC](https://github.com/verified-network-toolchain/Verified-FEC). `proofs/Poly/PolyField.v` is my pull request. I mainly use this to define the GF(256) field structure on bytes in `proofs/Poly/ByteField.v`, and then to prove the correctness of a procedure to populate the power, log, and inverse tables efficiently.\r\n\r\nI can port my proofs once the final PR is merged.
