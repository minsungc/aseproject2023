One question: I'm ready to resubmit the removed \"reshape_index_leq\" lemma, however if I do so, you'll have all the other from this pull request too. It doesn't really makes sense to strip the code to what is needed for this single lemma. Should I wait for this pull request being integrated ?"},{"author":"hivert","date":"2017-12-12T10:46:12Z","comment":"Thanks for the merge !\r\n\r\nOne final last comment: now that I have a non trivial contribution to math-comp, I'd be glad to have my name written somewhere in a contributor section ;-) Yes I know: those reseacher/developper with their ego...\r\n"},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2017-12-12T11:57:56Z","comment":"Good point, until the next release your name is at least in a commit so github automatically lists you as a contributor (https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/graphs/contributors).
