The `Prenex Implicits` command is a natural way of stating that a function constant should behave as in functional programming languages - something that ought to be supported by a global option or a pragma (once Coq gets these); `Context` declarations wouldn't quite work here as they would also affect lemmas. It seems rather wasteful to add one extra line for each function definition for this."},{"author":"anton-trunov","file":"mathcomp/algebra/matrix.v","date":"2018-11-26T09:01:07Z","comment":"Great!
