I tried to fix as you requested but didn't get satisfactory results on the following lemmas. I need to do some trial and error and think that the first one can be elegantly proved if `orderType` instances for `itv_bound` are provided. So may I contribute them as another PR after we finished #270?\r\n\r\n```\r\nLemma itv_intersectionE (x : R) (i1 i2 : interval R) :\r\n  x \\in itv_intersection i1 i2 = (x \\in i1) && (x \\in i2).\r\n\r\nLemma itv_intersection3E (i1 i2 i3 : interval R) :\r\n  exists x y, pred3 i1 i2 i3 x /\\ pred3 i1 i2 i3 y /\\\r\n              itv_intersection i1 (itv_intersection i2 i3) =\r\n              itv_intersection x y.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour comment on the statement of `itv_intersection3E` looks good to me. I'd like to try that. :)"}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-01-29T15:13:05Z","comment":" `try` -> `do 1?`"},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-01-29T15:13:38Z","comment":"`case` -> `case:`"},{"author":"pi8027","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-02-05T14:14:13Z","comment":"Yes, I did."},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-02-07T12:11:18Z","comment":"Names `H` and `H0` should not be used, please use \"meaningful names\"."},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-02-07T12:11:25Z","comment":"Names `H` and `H0` should not be used, please use \"meaningful names\"."},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-02-07T12:11:49Z","comment":"use `do ?` instead of `try`."},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/interval.v","date":"2019-02-07T12:12:41Z","comment":"use `do ?` instead of `try`.\r\nWhat is `auto` for?
