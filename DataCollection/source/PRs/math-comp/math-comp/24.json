Any objection?\n"},{"author":"ejgallego","date":"2016-02-09T16:47:01Z","comment":"Hi Assia,\n\nUps! Sorry for the noise, I had this on my TODO from mathcomp 1.5 times I guess and forgot to double check. Please close.\n\nIndeed it would make more sense to have it in `div`, the lemma seems to be added in 1.6 so I guess not a lot of users should be impacted by the change. I've updated the PR just in case.\n"},{"author":"amahboubi","date":"2016-02-09T16:51:29Z","comment":"Many thanks for the PR update!\n"},{"author":"ejgallego","date":"2016-02-09T16:56:25Z","comment":"Thanks Assia !\n"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[{"tag":"kind: enhancement","description":"Issue or PR about addition of features."}],"commits":[{"author":"ejgallego","committer":"ejgallego","hash":"fba0274616bc888726a18dc1990f9189e11521cd","message":"[div] Move dvdn_fact from prime to div.","date":"2016-02-09T16:49:25Z"}]}
