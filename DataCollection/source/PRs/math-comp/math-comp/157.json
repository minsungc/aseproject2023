Three quick observations:\r\n  - the naming convention for relativised lemmas is an `_in` suffix, see `seq.v` or `fintype.v` for instances.\r\n  - the generic predicate parameter `S` should be declared with the `pred_class` idiom, as this can make it easier to instantiate it explicitly.\r\n  - `ssrbool.v` provides helper lemmas (`in1T` and such) to derive unbounded lemmas from relativised ones."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"ybertot","committer":"ybertot","hash":"0f6e8b6af1fe87a6d691d02104879397c6c232eb","message":"Adds generalizations of theorems relying on injectivity\n\n- f_finv\n- finv_f\n- fconnect_sym\n- iter_order\n- iter_finv\n- cycle_orbit\n- fpath_finv (* I need to sub-theorems for this case. *)\n\nAll generalizations are named \"..._in\" the existing theorems are now\ninstances of the generalizations.","date":"2017-12-12T14:11:56Z"},{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"ybertot","hash":"ea60a9902aae4b685c8b4732febd0f7f4962c4d4","message":"shortening and refactoring","date":"2017-12-12T14:22:23Z"}]}
