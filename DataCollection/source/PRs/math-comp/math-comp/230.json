I am very interested in the Mathcomp contribution policy. Are there any plans of sharing it?\r\n\r\nI guess the policy would shed some light on the motivation for this particular decision. Was it backward compatibility or some other considerations as well?"},{"author":"gares","date":"2018-10-25T19:42:07Z","comment":"The statement up there is different, so it is not about backward compatibility. I guess the old statement was a but wrong, while this one states a property that is relevant to math comp, even if the lemma is not strictly necessary in this form. At least, this was my understanding of the discussion."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[{"tag":"kind: wontfix","description":"Issue that might never be attended."}],"commits":[{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"b239630a61a97d1b46c5059ce83eb6758a9648ba","message":"removing bool_irrelevance","date":"2018-09-12T12:49:06Z"}]}
