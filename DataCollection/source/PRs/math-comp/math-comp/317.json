So it is better than the previous one. Do you still see any possible improvements?\r\n\r\n> however, and also that we should put some thought in making the transport reduce, if we want this to be useful for computing directly with matrices.\r\n\r\n- I don't understand \"making the transport reduce\" in this sentence.\r\n- It is experimentally confirmed that the multiplication of n√ón matrices of integers can be optimized and its execution time has been improved from O(n^5) to O(n^3) in extracted code. But we would have no improvements on computations inside Coq. (CoqEAL is a better way to do it.)"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[{"tag":"needs: rebase","description":"PR which is not rebased: check the target is appropriate (generally master) and rebase on top of it."},{"tag":"needs: assignee","description":"Issue or PR that needs an assignee.
