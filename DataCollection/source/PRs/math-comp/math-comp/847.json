I like the new statement of `size_take` better but not having `minnElt` makes the scripts more cumbersome. In scripts, the place where it get  better  is the last application in  `seq.v` and in `tuple.v`.\r\n"},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2022-01-24T15:47:15Z","comment":"I suggest having an alternative statement `size_take_min` for this more general theorem."},{"author":"thery","date":"2022-01-24T17:33:42Z","comment":"@CohenCyril fine with me"},{"author":"proux01","date":"2022-01-25T09:23:00Z","comment":"Looks good, I'll merge by the end of the week if there is no further comment."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"thery","committer":"thery","hash":"2f78b63a9ac66e0a76973d5ec6d59f1c2d96a91d","message":"add lemma size_take_min","date":"2022-01-24T17:28:43Z"}]}
