This leads to something like: \r\n```\r\ncase def_s : _ _ _ _ / (split_find_nth x has_p) => [/= nz s1 s2 nz_p Ns2].\r\n```\r\nOn the other hand, the existing split lemmas have the same issue."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-09-07T16:07:37Z","comment":"@chdoc, `s` is non-discriminant because it is an index which is a variable, so putting it last would screw up the search for another index."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-09-07T23:02:12Z","comment":"> Please rebase\r\n\r\n@gares done"}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"chdoc","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/seq.v","date":"2020-09-03T08:58:30Z","comment":"If these lemmas are \"generalizations\" of findP, why do they take `has p s` as argument rather than replacing it?"},{"author":"chdoc","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/seq.v","date":"2020-09-03T09:03:28Z","comment":"Since this is basically `find_split` with the additional replacement of `nth x0 s i`, maybe this should be called `find_split_nth`.
