So indeed I'm puzzled to see that the command `make -f Makefile.coq -j ${NJOBS} all` run in the root folder by Travis CI systematically fails... maybe I forgot to update something? I'll try to investigate, but feel free to react if you've an idea where this configuration issue could come from! :)"},{"author":"erikmd","date":"2018-02-26T12:27:29Z","comment":"Actually I think I just forgot to update [the global Make file](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/master/mathcomp/Make) ; I'll test this and keep you informed"},{"author":"erikmd","date":"2018-02-26T13:28:54Z","comment":"After fixing this, the test build passed with Coq 8.6.1 on my PC.
