I thought I had already merged this (and that I had made a mistake by not squashing the commits together).  If the merge is still in order, I think we should do it with a squash of the commits together.  In my opinion, this PR is perfectly fine for this release.  This why I tagged it for the milestone."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"ec46a980d07b7fa63c093981cacad29f1734e86e","message":"Added ssrfun theorem `inj_compr`","date":"2019-11-18T15:34:02Z"}]}
