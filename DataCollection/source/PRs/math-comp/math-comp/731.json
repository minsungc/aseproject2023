I also chose to deprecate `bigcup_disjoint`, because it is merely one direction of the new `bigcup_disjointP` view lemma. Are such deprecations added to the CHANGELOG? If so, where?

If one adds the \"customary implicits\" (`Arguments bigcup_disjointP {T I U P F}.`) then `rewrite bigcup_disjoint` can be replaced by `rewrite (introT bigcup_disjointP)`. Without it one needs some parentheses and `_`. So in the unlikely case that this is really desirable, it can be done. And doesn't this argument apply to almost all reflection lemmas?"},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/finset.v","date":"2021-08-30T09:04:51Z","comment":"This equations looks to me like it should be the other way around"},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/finset.v","date":"2021-08-30T09:05:02Z","comment":"Same (other way around?)"},{"author":"chdoc","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/finset.v","date":"2021-08-30T13:44:28Z","comment":"Hmm, I agree, but @affeldt-aist already merged this. :flushed: "},{"author":"affeldt-aist","file":"mathcomp/ssreflect/finset.v","date":"2021-08-30T14:06:04Z","comment":"My bad.
