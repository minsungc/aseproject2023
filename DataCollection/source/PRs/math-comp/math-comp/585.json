So maybe there is a higher order induction scheme for this, but I did not figure it out, and went for an induction on the sequence instead."}],"tags":[{"tag":"kind: enhancement","description":"Issue or PR about addition of features."}],"commits":[{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"f5f093c6a19813fc1b44080b8c07d3ca4731c14a","message":"Kernel lemmas","date":"2020-09-28T20:42:23Z"}]}
