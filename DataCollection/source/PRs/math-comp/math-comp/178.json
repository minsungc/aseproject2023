I am very curious to see Laurent's use case though :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this generalization introduces no overhead when the rewrite rule is used from left to right, a minor overhead when used from right to left, so I am in favor of merging."},{"author":"amahboubi","date":"2018-03-06T13:37:40Z","comment":"Hi @thery ! Any response to @CohenCyril, who was asking about your use case?

Anyway the generalization seems natural to me."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"thery","committer":"thery","hash":"76ebc736158c97c23a47492bcda9f9daaedc7ed7","message":"generalize nth_iota","date":"2018-02-16T15:13:30Z"}]}
