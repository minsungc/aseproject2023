I guess @Sobernard, the original author, is the one to contact. @Sobernard , if we do not hear from you before the end of October, we will take ownership of the PR.

I guess one of `NumArchiClosedField` and `RealClosedArchiField` should be renamed (`ArchiClosed` or `ClosedArchi`?). *EDIT: these \"closed\" stand for different notions of closedness so probably OK. But then, this difference should be made clear in the header. I'm not sure if \"Archimedean closed field\" means \"algebraically closed field with \r\nthe Archimedean axiom\" in the usual mathematical convention. Also, \"Archimedean ... with an order and a norm\" does not make much sense to me since the Archimedean property requires an underlying order.*\r\nAlso putting `Archi` somewhere between `RealClosedField` is a bit unfortunate since it does not allow us to abbreviate it as `rcf`."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-12-03T20:34:37Z","comment":"I guess it should be `ArchiNumClosedField` and `ArchiRealClosedField` (the abbrev could be `archiRcf`)"},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-12-03T20:39:43Z","comment":"Although these are two \"distinct notion of closeness\" they are very related, indeed `is_real_closed R <-> is_algebraically_closed R[i]` (the left to right direction is proven in `complex.v` and the other direction must be trivial).
