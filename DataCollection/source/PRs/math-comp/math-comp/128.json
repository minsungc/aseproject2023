I tried to be nice to everyone, so I scheduled my PRs (and the API, that I'll help fixing) after the ones conflicting with them. so only the Sigma removal could have been done after the ssr merge.\r\n2. These overlays were often created before we agreed on the ssr merge.\r\n3. Adapting the overlays one by one to the code that we merge (which is significantly different from the one in the ssr repo) is probably more costly than fixing it once and for all.\r\n\r\nBut indeed, I wasn't sure about which way was best. Anyway, I think I made it as smooth as I could for everyone except Matej and I."}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"maximedenes","committer":"maximedenes","hash":"7e5f7949de0f1be496a7e6c3376f9858142f3e75","message":"Fix plugin after Sigma removal.","date":"2017-06-06T08:43:00Z"}]}
