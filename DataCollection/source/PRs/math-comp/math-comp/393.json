Regarding your question:\r\n> The notation is defined in ssrfun. Since most of this file lives in the Coq source now, I did not add a corresponding entry there. Would it make sense to do so?\r\n\r\nI think you should add a header to mathcomp's ssrfun, since you introduced the notation here. This is what happens, e.g., in file [ssreflect.v](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/5c4328261edace427e7cad73fdca288f6d73b87d/mathcomp/ssreflect/ssreflect.v#L9). I will merge as soon as you add this documentation."},{"author":"arthuraa","date":"2019-10-21T14:24:22Z","comment":"@amahboubi Sounds good!
