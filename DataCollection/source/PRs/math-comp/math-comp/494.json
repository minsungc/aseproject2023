Consequently, each mixin is now parameterized by a\n  class rather than a structure, and the corresponding factory parameterized by\n  a structure is provided to replace the use of the mixin. These factories have\n  the same names as in the mixins before this change except that `bLatticeMixin`\n  and `tbLatticeMixin` have been renamed to `bottomMixin` and `topMixin`\n  respectively.\n- Added a factory `distrLatticePOrderMixin` in order.v to build a\n  `distrLatticeType` from a `porderType`.","date":"2020-08-11T15:40:25Z"}]}
