Something related to `hide` not propagating the scopes of `iota_add`. In particular, `(ssreflect.Deprecation.hide (fun iota_add iotaD => _) iotaD (m - n) n)` interprets `m - n` in the ambiant stack of scopes (thus in `R_scope` in the case of Coquelicot) while it is expected to be interpreted in `nat_scope`."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-11-01T13:01:01Z","comment":"Thanks @herbelin !"}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"pi8027","file":"mathcomp/algebra/poly.v","date":"2020-10-09T17:58:02Z","comment":"Since `X` stands for a variable `polyX` in the polynomial theory, using it in `poly.v` for exponentiation may not be a good idea."},{"author":"CohenCyril","file":"mathcomp/algebra/poly.v","date":"2020-10-25T12:24:17Z","comment":"Yes indeed there is a tough call to make here...
