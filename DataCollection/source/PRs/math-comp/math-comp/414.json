Finite lattices have\n  top and bottom elements except for empty set. Therefore we removed finite\n  lattice structures without top and bottom.\n- Reorganize the theory modules in order.v:\n  + `LTheory` (lattice and partial order, without complement and totality)\n  + `CTheory` (`LTheory` + complement)\n  + `Theory` (all)\n- Give a unique head symbol for `Total.mixin_of`.\n- Replace reverse and `^r` with converse and `^c` respectively.\n- Fix packing and cloning functions and notations.\n- Provide more ordered type instances:\n  Products and lists can be ordered in two different ways: the lexicographical\n  ordering and the pointwise ordering. Now their canonical instances are not\n  exported to make the users choose them.\n- Export `Order.*.Exports` modules by default.\n- Specify the core hint database explicitly in order.v. (see #252)\n- Apply 80 chars per line restriction.\n\nGeneral changes:\n- Give consistency to shape of formulae and namings of `lt_def` and `lt_neqAle`\n  like lemmas:\n  lt_def    x y : (x < y) = (y != x) && (x <= y),\n  lt_neqAle x y : (x < y) = (x != y) && (x <= y).\n- Enable notation overloading by using scopes and displays:\n  + Define `min` and `max` notations (`minr` and `maxr` for `ring_display`) as\n    aliases of `meet` and `join` specialized for `total_display`.\n  + Provide the `ring_display` version of `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt`, `leif`, and\n    `comparable` notations and their explicit variants in `Num.Def`.\n  + Define 3 variants of `[arg min_(i < n | P) F]` and `[arg max_(i < n | P) F]`\n    notations in `nat_scope` (specialized for nat), `order_scope` (general\n    version), and `ring_scope` (specialized for `ring_display`).\n- Update documents and put CHANGELOG entries.","date":"2019-10-07T12:25:28Z"},{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"13a5482dda600d765753912bbe75cd12e74817a1","message":"fixing headers","date":"2019-10-07T12:25:28Z"},{"author":"pi8027","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"bba6fcff79a2b0a5bb76d077af4324f3c1e30b59","message":"Use `deprecate` notation in ssrnum","date":"2019-10-07T12:25:28Z"},{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"c6634cea72190ddbf1c0a93267174619e5b0ea4b","message":"Fixes in naming, mixins, doc and canonical ordering\n\n- comparer -> compare (in order.v)\n- eq constructor of compare goes last\n- \"x < y\" is matched before \"x > y\"\n- \"x <= y\" is matched before \"x >= y\"\n- adding prod and lexi ordering on tuple\n- adding missing CS\n- edit CHANGELOG","date":"2019-10-07T12:25:28Z"},{"author":"pi8027","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"2a23d99c80bd63cb2f11ba033bd3f30db1a83c5c","message":"Reorder the arguments of the comparison predicates in order.v\n\nThe comparison predicates (for nat, ordered types, ordered integral domains)\nmust have the following order of arguments:\n- leP   x y : le_xor_gt x y ...
