This PR partially addresses TODOs listed in https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/pull/270#issuecomment-545343995.\r\n\r\n> TODO list on order.v:\r\n> \r\n> * header:  remove misleading sentences, list the notations and definitions introduced by the library\r\n> * header: improve the documentation of what you get by importing selected of sub-modules\r\n\r\nDone by @affeldt-aist. The `Order.Def` is removed and the `Order.Syntax` is exported from `ssreflect.order` so I think we don't need to explain them.\r\n\r\n> * header: document better the tagging mechanism allowing to work with different order structures on a same type. This could be in the header and/or in later in the file\r\n\r\nNot done yet. This will be addressed by explaining \"instances for division on nat\".\r\n\r\n> * remove the no-op last Import\r\n> * BTW do we need Order.Def?\r\n\r\nDone. `Def` modules (`Order.Def`, `Order.POrderDef`, ...) are removed so that definitions should be accessed by using their qualified names (`Order.le`, `Order.lt`, ...).\r\n\r\n> * What about importing Order.Syntax in all of the subsequent Order.LTheory, Order.TTheory, etc. Note: a Syntax module is only useful to solve potential grammar conflicts. Which does not seem to be the case here.\r\n\r\nNow `Order.Syntax` is exported by default.\r\n\r\n> * ensure all notations do have a scope\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> * declare instances for division on nat inside this file, and use this as a documentation/template\r\n\r\nThat `porderType` instance is provided but not explained yet. I have a problem with proving `left_distributive gcdn lcmn` so there is no `latticeType` instance for this now."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2019-10-24T19:05:16Z","comment":"@amahboubi \r\n> @pi8027 Could you explain this PR?\r\n\r\nThis is a PR on top of https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/tree/experiment/order to amend it.
