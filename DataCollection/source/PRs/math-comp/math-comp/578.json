However, given the large number of largely boring lemmas, I wonder whether it would be possible to introduce a `contra:` tactic that automatically picks the right contra lemma, or even constructs it from the shape of the goal. However, I'm not sure how well that would work with the `comparable_*` lemmas.\r\n\r\nI see how we could do this using canonical structures / typeclasses ... but for now, let's keep it like this."},{"author":"CohenCyril","date":"2020-09-07T07:51:32Z","comment":"Please open an issue / feature request with your nice idea  :+1: "}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"828e60cae73eb7153d1f585f80b125f679dc0461","message":"Adding contra lemmas with orders\n\n- Adding contra lemmas between `leq`, `ltn`, `Order.le` (\"le\"),\n  `Order.lt` (\"lt\"), `b` (\"T\"), `~~ b` (\"N\"), `b = false` (\"F\"),\n  and `~ P` (\"not\").\n- Changelog for contra lemmas with orders\n\nCo-authored-by: Reynald Affeldt <reynald.affeldt@aist.go.jp>","date":"2020-09-05T14:17:21Z"}]}
