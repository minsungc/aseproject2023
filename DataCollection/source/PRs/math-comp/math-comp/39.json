There were two places where it broke, so that I added the Argument directive to remove the %function scope for the problematic arguments. As this only affects the notation below, I made it local so as not to interfere with the remainder of the files, even though I think it would not have changed anything in practice.\n"}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"ppedrot","committer":"ppedrot","hash":"08c04d63f46e4b97c1055e8d066ad08229a484aa","message":"Fixing compilation after the merge of PR trunk-function_scope.","date":"2016-04-08T13:22:53Z"}]}
