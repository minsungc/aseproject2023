Furthermore, it seems that the most wide spread convention is to use it as a separator as in `gtnNdvd`, `ltnNge`, `gtNdvdp` and at least 8 other occurrences of this kind... (cf `grep -e \"[a-z0-9]N[a-z0-9]\" **/*.v | grep \"Lemma\"` filtering out the numerous examples where  `N` is not a separtor) while the example you cite has exactly two occurences `ifN_eq` and `ifN_eqC`."},{"author":"thery","date":"2020-03-26T15:14:04Z","comment":"as there are so few occurrences we can still go either ways :smile:\r\nMaybe we can merge this pull request and leave the N as an issue for later\r\n"},{"author":"ybertot","date":"2020-03-31T12:42:24Z","comment":"Thanks @CohenCyril and @thery "}],"review_discussion":[],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"b1af144ee49faf7599385eeaf47d1d9baa633579","message":"Theorems about find and index","date":"2020-01-28T16:03:45Z"},{"author":"CohenCyril","committer":"CohenCyril","hash":"4e07cebda75984127bd2a37c99de3105bb28cf2e","message":"Added lemmas about foldl, scanl, foldr and rcons and cons","date":"2020-01-28T16:04:46Z"}]}
