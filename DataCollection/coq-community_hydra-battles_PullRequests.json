It never contains more than one commit.\n\nFor the record, my initial plan was indeed to push an artifact and not a GitHub Pages branch, but GitHub Actions won't allow viewing the PDF in the browser in that case (it encapsulates it in a zip archive). GitLab CI is superior here, but using it would introduce additional complexity (not worth it IMHO)."}],"review_discussion":[{"author":"palmskog","file":".github/workflows/build-pdf.yml","date":"2020-10-20T20:07:33Z","comment":"shouldn't this be `mkdir -p` if you want to avoid errors when the directory exists?"},{"author":"Zimmi48","file":".github/workflows/build-pdf.yml","date":"2020-10-20T20:12:00Z","comment":"Yeah, why not make it future-proof indeed!"},{"author":"Zimmi48","file":".github/workflows/build-pdf.yml","date":"2020-10-20T20:12:38Z","comment":"```suggestion\r\n          mkdir -p public\r\n```"}],"tags":[],"commits":[{"author":"Zimmi48","committer":"Zimmi48","hash":"46b25fecbf94c80f9a9e91eb1234777b52f6347d","message":"Add workflow for building and uploading PDF.\n\nOnly updates the PDF on GitHub Pages when running in branch master.\n\nWhen on pull requests or other branches, the PDF is still built and\nmade available as an artifact to ease reviewing.","date":"2020-10-20T17:06:51Z"},{"author":"Zimmi48","committer":"web-flow","hash":"c59f5e7590208ee75f90498a0fe26ca18071a01a","message":"Make mkdir step future-proof.","date":"2020-10-20T20:12:56Z"}]},{"author":"Casteran","number":1,"diff_summary":[{"file":"Makefile","status":"M","additions":2,"deletions":3},{"file":"src/make_project","status":"M","additions":2,"deletions":3}],"state":"merged","open_date":"2020-10-20T13:29:08Z","update_date":"2020-10-20T19:48:37Z","discussion":[{"author":"palmskog","date":"2020-10-20T16:48:08Z","comment":"@Zimmi48 @Casteran this is unfortunately still quite far from best practices w.r.t. makefiles and build scripting.
